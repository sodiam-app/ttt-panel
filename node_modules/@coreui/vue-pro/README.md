## Quick start

### Instalation

Several quick start options are available:

- [Download the latest release](https://github.com/coreui/coreui-vue-pro/archive/v4.3.0.zip)
- Clone the repo: `git clone https://github.com/coreui/coreui-vue-pro.git`
- Install with [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/): `npm install @coreui/vue-pro`
- Install with [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/): `yarn add @coreui/vue-pro`

Read the [Getting started page](https://coreui.io/vue/docs/getting-started/introduction/) for information on the framework contents, templates and examples, and more.

### Stylesheets

Vue components are styled using `@coreui/coreui-pro` CSS library, but you can use them also with bootstrap CSS library. That is possible because `@coreui/coreui-pro` library is compatible with bootstrap, it just extends its functionalities. The only exception are custom CoreUI components, which don't exist in the Bootstrap ecosystem.

#### Installation

```bash
yarn add @coreui/coreui-pro
```

or

```bash
npm install @coreui/coreui-pro --save
```

#### Basic usage

```js
import '@coreui/coreui-pro/dist/css/coreui.min.css'
```
